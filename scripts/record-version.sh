# Per-target inputs:
#   EXTENDDB_REF       extenddb, extenddb-sqlite - the release tag/ref built

#
# Sources, by target:
#   dynamodb              live AWS service (no version)
#   dynoxide / dynalite   npm published version (`npm view`)
#   dynoxide-wasm         the triggering dynoxide release, else the version the
#                         wasm engine publishes for itself on npm
#   localstack            its /_localstack/info version endpoint
#   extenddb              the built release tag; the SQLite row reports the

#                         different storage feature rather than its own build

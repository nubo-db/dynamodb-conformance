 * Overlay a snapshot with the region its headline was earned in.

 *
 * The join. `byRunDate` is keyed on the AWS sweep date, while each target entry
 * inside carries its own run date, and they are not always the same: a summary
 * committed after a later target run holds that later run's numbers under the
 * earlier sweep's key. Overlaying on the key alone put 24 July's figures on the
 * 22 July run for all eight targets, so a row published 12.3% beside its own
 * count of 213 fails in 998. The entry now has to agree with the snapshot about
 * which run it describes, or it is not applied at all.
 *
 * The scope. Only the headline scalars were overlaid, leaving `tiers` and the
 * raw counts on the port's own basis. Under correctness that was invisible,
 * because tier figures had their own denominators and nothing had to reconcile.
 * Divergence is additive, so it does reconcile - or fails to in public: the
 * tiers no longer decomposed the headline, `failed / count` no longer equalled
 * the published divergence, and the README (which takes every column from the
 * headline region) disagreed with the board. The whole region entry is applied
 * now, so a row is one region's measurement throughout.
 *
 * Coverage is the same in every region either way. `verdictsForRegion` only ever
 * swaps a pass for a fail and passes skips and indeterminates through untouched,
 * so implemented and total are region-invariant by construction - verified
 * across every committed sweep. Divergence is a property of a target measured
 * against a region; coverage is a property of the target.

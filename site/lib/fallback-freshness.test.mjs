// someone regenerates it, and the site renders them without complaint.

// That is not hypothetical. Changing movement from correctness to divergence
// inverted its meaning - lower is now better - while the fallback still held
// movement computed the old way. The page showed a red-flavoured "fell 0.2

// target whose failures had just gone from 16 to 18. The board said a
// regression was an improvement.

// This checks the stored values against the row's own raw counts, so it fails
// on a stale fallback without needing the network or a rebuild. Regenerate with

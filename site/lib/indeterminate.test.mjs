// A run carrying indeterminates is not scored. The suite decides that once, in
// axesOf, because both other readings let an infrastructure fault move a
// published letter: counting an indeterminate against coverage lets a timeout
// lower a grade, and taking it out of the denominator makes converting a fail
// into a 503 cheaper than withdrawing the test.
//
// Four surfaces restated `failed / count` inline instead of calling axesOf, so
// four surfaces quietly dropped that decision - the site published figures and
// a letter for a run the README printed "-" for. Nothing caught it because no
// fixture anywhere carried an indeterminate. This is that fixture, and it holds
// the contract on each surface rather than on the helper, since the helper was
// never the thing that was wrong.

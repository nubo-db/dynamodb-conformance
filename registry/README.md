# Split registry

`splits.json` records every admitted **regional split**: a behaviour where two
or more real DynamoDB regions give different, definite answers to the same
request. The suite scores targets against per-region expectations, and this
file is the only source of those expectations. A test with no row here is
region-invariant - the same expectation applies everywhere.

`regions.json` tracks per-region sweep health: when each region last produced
a complete result set, and how many consecutive sweeps it has failed to. A
region that misses two consecutive sweeps is dropped from scoring and a
maintainer is paged, in the same act.

`suite-manifest.json` lists every test the suite defines, by file path and
full test name. Divergence and coverage are both measured over the whole
suite, and this is what "the whole suite" means: the denominator under every
published figure, and the population the ground-truth row must span before it
derives. It used to be inferred from whichever target had run the most tests,
which left one of the measured things deciding what it was measured against.

Unlike `splits.json` this one is generated, by `npm run suite:manifest`, and
CI fails if it drifts from the tests. Regenerate it in the same commit as any
test you add, move, or rename.

## What a row means

A row is a claim of the form "on this behaviour, these named regions returned
these answers, observed on these dates". It carries:

- the test it keys to (file path plus full test name, matching the Vitest
  JSON output),
- what each named region actually returned,
- which of those answers the committed test asserts (`pinned` names the
  region whose recorded answer the assertion encodes; a target passing the
  committed test has matched that answer and no other),
- when the divergence was first observed and last confirmed,
- the capture files holding the raw evidence,
- who admitted it, when, and under which issue.

Every answer in a row is a *definite* answer. A timeout, a throttle, or a
transport failure is not evidence of anything and can never appear here; a
row needs at least two regions whose definite answers differ.

## Why only a human writes this file

Nothing writes `splits.json` automatically. The weekly sweep detects
candidate splits, re-confirms them, and opens an issue with the evidence; a
maintainer reviews it and commits the row by hand.

That gate is what keeps "real DynamoDB is ground truth" true. An automated
writer would launder whatever a region happened to do - including a regional
AWS defect, or plain noise - straight into the baseline, and every target
would then be scored against it. Admitting a row commits the project to
treating both sides of the divergence as correct DynamoDB behaviour, and
that judgement stays with a person.

The same applies in reverse: when regions that previously disagreed converge
again, the sweep opens a reconciliation issue rather than editing or deleting
the row itself.

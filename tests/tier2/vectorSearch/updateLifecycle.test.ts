  // as GSIs. The walk on this path differs from the CreateTable path in three

  // IS reported (false during early CREATING, true while backfilling, absent
  // once done), and SearchVectors rejects the whole time — first with "The
  // table does not have the specified index", then with "Cannot search
  // backfilling vector index". DescribeTable flipping to ACTIVE can lead the
  // search plane by a beat, so readiness is proven by a search succeeding,
  // never by the description alone.

  // All of that is now the documented sequence too, so the assertions below
  // pin it rather than describing it. The developer guide previously built its
  // waiting advice around an ACTIVE-plus-Backfilling-true state this walk never
  // occupies; it now numbers the same three steps this test observes. See

// The third result state, typed at the moment it happens.
//
// A conformance result is only meaningful when the target actually answered.
// A timeout, a throttle the SDK's retry could not outlast, or a transport
// failure is not a different answer - it is the absence of one, and it must
// stay structurally distinct from a real pass or fail all the way into the
// published artefact. This module is where that distinction is minted:
// anything that carries a real DynamoDB answer (a ValidationException, a
// ResourceNotFoundException, a ConditionalCheckFailedException) is never
// classified here, because a definite answer - even a rejection - is a result.
//
// Dependency-light and duck-typed on purpose: the error objects inspected in
// afterEach hooks have been cloned into plain objects by the test runner, so
// nothing in this file may rely on instanceof for detection. The one import is
// the unsupported-fault predicate, which is dependency-free for this reason.

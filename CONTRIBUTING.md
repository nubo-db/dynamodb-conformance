# Contributing to the DynamoDB Conformance Suite

Thanks for considering a contribution. This suite's value depends on
one invariant: every test passes against real AWS DynamoDB. Keep that
in mind and most of what follows is routine.

If you are using an AI coding tool (Codex, Cursor, Aider, Claude
Code, or similar), please also read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md); it covers
the same ground in a form those tools pick up automatically.

## Before you start

- Open a GitHub issue describing the change if it is more than a
  small test addition or fix. A short paragraph is enough.
- Adding new tiers, changing how a tier is defined, or touching the
  results pipeline needs discussion first.

## Test philosophy

Tests encode real AWS DynamoDB behaviour. Implementations are checked
against real DynamoDB, not against each other; two emulators agreeing
on a wrong answer does not move the baseline. Ground truth is recorded
per region: where real regions genuinely disagree, the split registry
(`registry/splits.json`) records each region's answer, and a target
passes if it matches at least one observed region. Only a maintainer
admits a registry row. Run new or modified
tests against real AWS DynamoDB where you can. If you cannot run
against real AWS, flag that in the PR and a maintainer will verify
before merging. If real DynamoDB rejects a test, the test is wrong;
do not adjust the assertion to make an emulator pass. The suite
exists precisely so emulator authors cannot mark their own homework.
See `AGENTS.md` for the fuller version.

## What a new test needs to demonstrate

Before opening a PR that adds or modifies a test:

1. **Required:** the test passes against real AWS DynamoDB in one
   region - whichever you can reach. The weekly sweep covers the rest
   and will surface any regional split your test happens to land on.
2. **Required:** the test runs cleanly against at least one emulator
   target. Dynoxide is the easiest local target (no Docker, no JVM);
   DynamoDB Local, Dynalite, and LocalStack are fine alternatives if
   you have them to hand.
3. **Optional but helpful:** note in the PR description how the test
   behaves across more than one emulator.
4. **Consider the rejection path, not just acceptance.** If the
   behaviour has inputs real DynamoDB rejects (a malformed expression,
   an out-of-range parameter, a key that doesn't match the schema),
   cover the rejection too, not only the accepted form. A target that
   is too lenient passes acceptance-only tests while still diverging
   from DynamoDB. Put the error-code check in the operation's own tier
   (or `tests/tier3/validation-ordering/`) and the exact message, where
   it's stable, in `tests/tier3/error-messages/`.
5. **Required if you added, moved or renamed a test:** regenerate both
   manifests in the same commit. `node scripts/suite-manifest.mjs`
   rewrites `registry/suite-manifest.json`, the count every published
   figure divides by, and CI fails the PR if it is stale. `npm run
   results:tags` rewrites `results/tag-manifest.json`, which groups the
   published results by capability; its guard reports a stale manifest
   as a failing test in `npm run test:tooling`, so it looks like a
   broken test rather than a missing step.

   Renaming a test also invalidates every committed results file, which
   names its tests in full, so a rename needs those targets re-run
   before the manifest will publish. Land one with a results refresh
   rather than alongside a coverage change.

Regenerating the published results table across every tracked target
is a maintainer task and does not block your PR.

## Local setup

- Node + npm. No global tooling needed.
- `npm install` to install dependencies.
- `npm test` runs the full suite against whatever endpoint
  `DYNAMODB_ENDPOINT` points to. See the `README.md` for the usual
  patterns.

### Table namespaces

The suite creates tables under a prefix, and cleans up by deleting every
table matching it. That cleanup runs once per run, before anything is
created, so two runs sharing a prefix will delete each other's tables
mid-suite.

Local runs and CI therefore use different namespaces:

| Where | Prefix |
|---|---|
| CI | `_conformance_` |
| Anywhere else | `_capture_` |

The choice comes from `CONFORMANCE_TABLE_PREFIX` when it is set, and
otherwise from whether `CI` is set. You should not need to touch it. The
AWS credentials for each side are scoped to match, so a run in the wrong
namespace fails with `AccessDeniedException` rather than deleting tables
belonging to something else.

If you are running two local suites against the same account at once,
give each one its own `CONFORMANCE_TABLE_PREFIX`.

## Tests

- Tests live under `tests/tier1/`, `tests/tier2/`, `tests/tier3/`,
  grouped by the definition of each tier in the `README.md`.
- Prefer the existing wait/retry helpers over `setTimeout` sleeps.

### Declare the tables your file uses

Shared tables are created on demand, so a file has to say which ones it needs.
Call `declareTables` once at module scope, naming every shared def the file
goes on to use:

```ts
import { compositeTableDef, declareTables, hashTableDef } from '../../../src/helpers.js'

declareTables(hashTableDef, compositeTableDef)
```

Setup creates the tables the running file declared and nothing else, which is
what lets `--tags-filter='!gsi and !lsi'` produce a run that never creates a
table with a secondary index. Leave a table out and the file passes a full run,
because some other file will have created it, then fails on a narrower run with
`ResourceNotFoundException`. `npm run test:tooling` checks the declaration
against what the file actually references, in both directions.

Use `compositeIndexedTableDef` rather than `compositeTableDef` if you need a
secondary index; the plain composite table has none. Any file declaring it
needs both `gsi` and `lsi` tags, since it carries both kinds.

### Tag your test

Every top-level `describe` takes a `tags` array as its second argument: the
operation it covers, exactly one plane (`data-plane` or `control-plane`), and
any cross-cutting tag that applies (`cloud-only`, `gsi`, `lsi`, `legacy`,
`slow`).

```ts
describe('Query — GSI', { tags: ['query', 'data-plane', 'gsi'] }, () => {
  // ...
})
```

A tag can also go on an individual test, and has to when only some of the tests
in a describe exercise the capability. Legacy parameters are the usual case: a
rejection test that sends `Expected` alongside `ConditionExpression` belongs
next to its expression-parameter counterpart, so the file stays readable, but
only that one test depends on legacy support.

```ts
describe('PutItem — validation', { tags: ['put-item', 'data-plane'] }, () => {
  it('rejects mixing expression and non-expression parameters', { tags: ['legacy'] }, async () => {
    // ...
  })
})
```

Tags add up rather than replace, so that test resolves to `put-item`,
`data-plane` and `legacy`. Tagging the whole describe instead would drop every
other case in it from a `--tags-filter='!legacy'` run.

The vocabulary lives in `src/tags.ts` - add a tag there before using it, or
`strictTags` rejects the run. The coverage guard (`npm run test:tooling`) fails
if a top-level describe is left untagged, and also if a test sends something a
tag exists for without carrying it - a legacy request parameter, a PartiQL
command. So feature filters like `--tags-filter='!partiql'` never silently miss
a test. See "Filtering by feature" in the `README.md` for the full vocabulary.

### Tier 3 sub-directory choice

If a new Tier 3 test cares about the exact error message string, put
it in `tests/tier3/error-messages/`. If it only needs to confirm
which validation fired or which error code came back, put it in
`tests/tier3/validation-ordering/`. Limit and shape errors go in
`tests/tier3/limits/`. Legacy API request shapes go in
`tests/tier3/legacy-api/`.

`error-messages/` uses inline `try/catch` with
`expect(err).toBeInstanceOf(...)`, an exact `expect(err.name).toBe(...)`,
and a message assertion whose strictness fits the message:

- **Exact** (`expect(err.message).toBe(...)`) when the whole string is
  stable across regions and over time. Most messages are, so this stays
  the default.
- **Structural** (`expect(err.message).toContain(...)` on the contractual
  core - the field and the constraint phrase) when AWS's rendering is
  non-deterministic. The `N validation error detected:` envelope, the
  echoed input value, and field-name casing all vary by region (see the
  2026-06 four-region capture, and `registry/splits.json` for behavioural
  splits) and are not part of the contract the API
  model defines, so don't pin them. Pin what is invariant across regions
  and float the rest. This is the same idea as `createTable.test.ts`'s
  backend-variant handling.

`limits/` makes the same exact-or-structural choice, on the same grounds.
It had no stated rule until a nesting-depth message gained a
`N validation error detected:` envelope in the pinned region and nothing
noticed: the test matched on an unanchored regex that both wordings
satisfy, so no verdict moved and the weekly sweep saw nothing. A tolerant
assertion is often the right call, but it means the test cannot detect
regional drift on that behaviour, so the per-region answers have to be
recorded in `registry/splits.json` and the row has to say the assertion
does not enforce them. Tolerance that nothing writes down is
indistinguishable from agreement.

Don't use the `expectDynamoError` helper in `error-messages/` - it always
routes the message through `toContain`, so it can't express the exact
rung; use it (or a direct `toContain`) in `validation-ordering/`.

For error messages with a stable prefix and a variable reason or
identifier suffix (`TransactionCanceledException` is the obvious
case), build the expected message from a known reasons array and
structurally cross-check `CancellationReasons[].Code` against the
same array. See `tests/tier3/error-messages/conditionalCheck.test.ts`
for the pattern.

## Commit style

Short subject, lower-case, imperative where possible. A Conventional
Commits-style prefix (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`,
`ci:`) is preferred when one fits but is not a gate. Bodies are
welcome for anything non-obvious.

## Releases and the published board

Write your changelog notes under `## Unreleased` in `CHANGELOG.md` as part
of the PR. The release gives that section its date and version, so several
branches can write ahead of one cut.

**The board measures the most recent release tag, not `main`.** Merging a
test does not move the published figures. It still runs against real AWS on
the way in, which is what validates it, but the numbers move at the next
release and a dated changelog entry explains the move.

Cutting one is a single dispatch of the **Cut a release** workflow in the
Actions tab, with a version like `3.2.0`. It bumps `package.json` and the
lockfile, dates the `## Unreleased` section, installs against the bumped
tree, tags, and opens the release as a **draft**. Then it starts a
conformance run at the new tag. A full run takes about three hours; when the
board carrying that version lands, the draft publishes itself.

So a draft sitting open means the measurement has not finished. If its run
failed, dispatch **Conformance Tests** from `main` and set its `ref` input to
the tag. That runs the same path to completion and finishes the release.
Selecting the tag as the workflow's own ref instead measures it correctly and
publishes nothing, because the board is only published from a run whose branch
is `main`.

### What a release does and does not explain

A release explains movement in the *denominator*: the suite the board divides
by, and the tests it is composed of. It does not explain every movement on
the board. Four things move figures, and only the first is tied to a
release.

1. **The suite changed.** More tests, or different ones. This is what a
   changelog entry dates, and it moves every target's divergence and coverage
   because they all divide by the suite size.
2. **A target changed.** Each target carries its own version, published in
   `results/summary.json` and in the README's Version column. It moves when
   that target ships a build, or when live AWS drifts under it. No release of
   this suite is involved.
3. **Region health changed.** The weekly sweep can drop a region that stopped
   answering, or re-admit one. That moves the observed set, which decides
   every target's cohort and headline. Health is read as it stands today
   rather than as it stood at the tag, because a region that stopped
   answering yesterday is a fact about today.
4. **The same suite was measured again.** Live AWS is the oracle, not a
   fixture, so re-measuring one tag can legitimately produce different figures
   from the last time it was measured. Two boards naming the same commit are
   independent observations, which is why each one records the region it ran
   in and when.
